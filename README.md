This repository is based out of the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction.

I have used extensive data cleansing methodology (used 1 million out of the 55 million rows of data in the train dataset).
For modelling, I have used a Random Forest with an LGBM boosting. I got a score of 3.3 which put me in the top 20% of the pariticipants.

The train dataset is massive - of about 55 million rows - and can be downloaded from here https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data
